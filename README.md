  - Filter logs by level (Verbose, Debug, Info, Warning, Error).
  - Search for specific keywords within the logs.

- **Interactive Shell**:
  - Execute custom ADB shell commands directly from the application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) must be installed and accessible. The application bundles an ADB binary for convenience.

### Dependencies

The application relies on the PyQt6 library.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd adb-front
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install System Libraries (for Linux)

On Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu), you may need to install additional system libraries for PyQt6 to function correctly.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libxcb-cursor0
```

## How to Run

After completing the installation steps, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python adb.py
```

The application window should appear, and it will automatically detect any connected devices.
